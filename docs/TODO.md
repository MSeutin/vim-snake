# TODO

## Refactoring
- [ ] Break down the `Snake` class into smaller, more focused classes.
- [ ] Implement the MVC pattern for clearer separation of concerns.

## Documentation
- [ ] Document all functions and classes using Python docstring standards.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive guide in `docs/`.

## Testing
- [ ] Set up a testing framework using Python's `unittest`.
- [ ] Write unit tests for each component (snake logic, food placement, etc.).

## Packaging and Distribution
- [ ] Create a standalone executable using PyInstaller.
- [ ] Prepare the package for distribution on PyPI.
- [ ] Test on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).

Project Namespace: If your project is structured as a package, the namespace provides context. For instance, if someone uses your game as a package named vim_snake, they might access your classes like vim_snake.GameModel. This clearly indicates that GameModel belongs to the vim_snake project.

GameModel (Model)

Handles the game's core logic and state.
Includes information about the snake's position, movement, and growth.
Manages the food's position.
Keeps track of the game score and other state-related variables like game over conditions.
GameView (View)

Responsible for all the game's rendering and display aspects.
Uses the curses library to draw the game state on the screen, including the snake, the food, the score, and any additional UI elements like game over screens.
GameController (Controller)

Manages user input and translates it into actions within the game model.
Interprets key presses and updates the GameModel accordingly.
Acts as the intermediary between the GameModel and the GameView, ensuring that user actions affect the game state and are reflected in the display.
Snake (Class within Model)

Specifically represents the snake in the game.
Manages the snake's body segments, movement direction, and collision detection with itself or the game boundaries.
Food (Class within Model)

Represents the food object in the game.
Manages the position and possibly other properties of the food.
Main (Application Entry Point)

Not a class, but the main script (main.py) where the game loop is run.
Initializes the MVC components and controls the game flow.
